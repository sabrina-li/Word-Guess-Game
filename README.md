### How to play:
* After page is loaded, you start with 12 lives.

* Start typing a-z to guess the word. All words are Harry Potter charactor names and are NOT case sensitive. If you type anything other than a-z, game will do nothing.

* When the letter you typed is part of the word, it will show up in the page to replace the dashes.

* If you type the same letter twice, game will do nothing. All letters that are not part of the name is shown at the bottom

* Once you guess the entire name, a prompt will show and you can choose to keep playing. Your lives will reset to 12 everytime you win.

* Enjoy a little quote or music when you win the round and see the charactors picture change on the left

* If you run out of lives, you lose and you can choose to start over.
